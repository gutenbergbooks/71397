<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>Prompted by the many telephone calls and inquiries received at the
Rhode Island Poison Control and Information Centers regarding plants,
flowers, and berries, the State Department of Health has developed
the information contained in this booklet. It will aid families in
planning safe gardens, give fuller knowledge of wild plants, and, in
the case of an accidental ingestion, provide assistance in identifying
the plant. Since verbal descriptions are frequently inadequate, and
nonprofessional determination of species often uncertain, there has been
a need for a more expedient means of identifying plants and their toxicity.</p>

<p>Because the toxicity of these plants will vary with the size of the
child, the season, and the quantity and part of the plant eaten, it is
necessary that a physician determine the necessary treatment for each case.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_120">
<p class="no-indent"><b>THIS BOOKLET ENCOURAGES THE EMPTYING OF THE
STOMACH OF A VICTIM BY VOMITING AS A GENERAL
MEASURE IN PREVENTING SERIOUS INJURY.</b></p>

<p class="no-indent"><b>VOMITING SHOULD NOT BE INDUCED IF THE VICTIM
IS UNCONSCIOUS OR CONVULSING.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Some basic information is included for physicians who might be
unaware of the toxic principles and their effects in these particular
plants. Although the seriousness of each accident must be judged
individually, it is necessary that the plant be accurately identified
and that sufficient information on its toxicity be readily available.
Many other poisonous plants could have been included in this booklet,
but, the purpose was to discuss those found most commonly, although
not exclusively, in the New England States.</p>

<p>The names and telephone numbers of the Poison Control Centers
in the New England area are included for the convenience of your
physician. (<a href="#Page_21">See page 21</a>.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AMANITA MUSHROOM</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_001.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="340" >
  <p class="f120 spb1">Amanita, fly agaric<br><i>Amanita muscaria—AGARICACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> One of the most
poisonous of the mushrooms (toadstools). Found mostly in woody areas,
along roadsides, and waste places, especially at the base of pine and
similar trees. Unlike many edible mushrooms, this poisonous amanita has
a fleshy bulb-like base and yellow stalk (stipe) with scaly growths
and a cap or top (pileus). Often a white ring (annulus) of soft
ragged tissue may be observed on the stalk under its cap. All amanita
mushrooms should, in general, be considered poisonous. The top, which
may be 3 to 6 inches wide, varies in color from bright orange to red
with white to gray warty growths on it. Under the cap are numerous very
white gills which distinguish this mushroom from most edible types.
The latter usually have pink to purple gills. These mushrooms form in
groups, or are scattered.</p>

<p>Other poisonous mushrooms found in New England are the Death Cup,
<i>Amanita phalloides</i>; jack-o’-lantern, <i>Clitocybe illudens</i>;
Shaggy mane, <i>Coprinus comatus</i>; and the <i>Boletus</i> and
<i>Russula</i> species. There are many others. Perhaps the best
precaution is to avoid eating any mushroom not certified by an expert
to be edible.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> All portions are
poisonous. The chief toxic principle is an alkaloid, <b>muscarine</b>.
Amanita poisoning is characterized by intense sweating, salivation,
wheezing, irregular breathing and heart beat. If not treated promptly,
it <b>can be fatal</b> within an hour depending upon quantities consumed.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor.
Have patient vomit. Physicians perform gastric lavage and treat for
<b>muscarine</b> alkaloid poisoning or excessive muscarinic stimulation
of the parasympathetic nervous system, also dehydration. Atropine and
other similar drugs counteract the effects of <b>muscarine</b>.

<h2 class="nobreak">BANEBERRY</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="f120 spb1">Baneberry, snakeberry<br><i>Actaea rubra
            and Actaea alba—RANUNCULACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> The red and white
baneberries are perennial herbs found in woodlands and occasionally as
showy plants in gardens. Leaves are large on many branches and resemble
those of the wildcurrant. The small flowers are white in spring. Plants
generally grow about 1 to 2 feet in height. The attractive parts are
the red or white berries which develop during summer and early autumn.
They are in clusters on terminal flower stalks, each on a conspicuous
short fleshy pedicel. Children have been poisoned by eating the
berries.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The root stock,
sap, and berries. These produce marked irritation of the stomach and
intestines causing nausea and violent purgation. If absorbed, the acrid
principles can affect the heart, increase the pulse rate, and cause
dizziness. Fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor. Have
patient vomit. Physicians perform gastric lavage and treat gastric
inflammation and circulatory failure.</p>

  <p class="f120 spb1">European bittersweet, blue nightshade, woody nightshade<br>
          <i>Solanum dulcamara—SOLANACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> A woody climbing or
reclining herb with slender stems and dark green pointed leaves which
may be purplish-green when young. Clusters of white or purplish-white
flowers borne on a 5-pointed, wheel-shaped base (calyx). During
summer and early fall, fruits become attractive berries, bright red
to scarlet, and are scattered in clusters. They remain when leaves
fall.</p>

<p>This weed is found in numerous areas, such as on dumps, along fence
walls, and generally in moist, rich soil conditions. It is a common
weed in many gardens, near dwellings or in fields, and is related to
the black and deadly nightshades.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="fs_120"><b>NOTE</b></span>. The
black nightshade, American bittersweet or poison berry (<i>Solarium
nigrum-SOLANACEAE</i>) closely resembles the European bittersweet,
excepting the berries which are purple or black. It contains the same
poisonous principles.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> Chiefly the
leaves and unripe fruits. The red berries (black berries of the black
nightshade) can be poisonous if several are eaten. The plant contains
<b>solanine</b>, <b>dulcamarin</b>, and similar principles which
are related to the alkaloids of the deadly nightshade. Poisoning is
characterized by burning in the throat, nausea, dizziness, dilation of
eye pupils, convulsions, and general muscular weakness.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor.
Have patient vomit. Physicians treat for alkaloids, as in atropine
poisoning.</p>

  <p class="f120 spb1">Bloodroot<br><i>Sanguinaria canadensis—PAPAVERACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> Perennial,
low-growing herbs which appear early in spring in shady, moist wooded
areas. The many-petaled, white flower frequently develops first on a
stalk wrapped with a single large-lobed leaf. The large underground
stem (rhizome) and smaller roots of the bloodroot contain an orange to
red juice from which the plant gets its name. This is poisonous.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The underground
stems, roots, and their red contents. These contain several toxic
alkaloids, chiefly <b>sanguinarine</b>, which irritate the mucous
membranes of the mouth, throat, and stomach causing intense burning,
nausea, and vomiting. If absorbed, the alkaloids can affect the
nervous system, depress the heart, cause coma, and produce temporary
paralysis.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor. Have
patient vomit, and then give warm milk. Physicians perform gastric
lavage and treat irritated gastro-intestinal tract. In the event that
much of the root material has been ingested and absorbed, measures
should be taken to prevent circulatory collapse.</p>

  <p class="f120 spb1">Castor bean, castor oil plant, palma Christi<br>
              <i>Ricinus communis—EUPHORBIACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> There are many
varieties of the castor bean plant growing in gardens and greenhouses.
The plant is cultivated commercially in southern climates for the
castor oil produced by the seeds. It grows to 8 feet or more in height
with large showy palm like, dark green leaves on long stalks.</p>

<p>Flowers are not very attractive but the clusters of soft spiny
fruits which form in late summer and early fall, split open to yield
very attractively marked shiny seeds. These possess variegated white
to brown and black striations and are shaped somewhat like the tick
insect. Because of the attractive appearance, they become playthings
for children.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The beans or
seeds contain the toxic substances <b>ricin</b> and <b>ricinine</b>.
<b>Ricin</b> is exceedingly poisonous due to its irritant action which
causes nausea, vomiting, intestinal cramps, stupor, and sometimes
convulsions and circulatory collapse several hours after seeds are
ingested. <b>Ricin</b> may produce hemolysis.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor. Have
patient vomit. Physicians perform gastric lavage and maintain fluid and
electrolyte balance and employ symptomatic measures.</p>

              <i>Helleborus niger—RANUNCULACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> In warmer climates,
the large blossoms of this plant appear in midwinter, hence, the common
name Christmas rose. However, these develop much earlier in fall or
later in spring in New England and other northern areas.</p>

<p>The plant is a perennial evergreen herb with a black underground
stem and roots. Each year a single palmately divided leaf and flower
stalk form, the latter with one or two large purplish-white flowers,
each with five petals and a yellow center whorl of flower parts. Found
in gardens usually as a cultivated plant.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> An intensely
irritating glycoside principle, <b>helleborein</b>, has been found
in the leaves and roots. This probably accounts for much of the skin
inflammation caused on contact with bruised parts or the juice of this
plant. Other poisonous glycosides and alkaloids which affect the heart
(similar to the effects of digitalis) and nervous system (as from
aconite) are also present. If ingested, the plant may cause vomiting,
tingling and numbing sensations in the mouth, and violent purgation.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor.
Wash the skin at once with soap and water if the juice of the plant
is in contact with it. Have patient vomit if any part has been eaten.
Physicians treat for dermatitis and vesication if a contact poisoning.
When there is evidence of much ingestion treat for <b>digitalis</b> or
<b>aconitine</b> poisoning, depending upon symptoms.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> A low, woody plant
found in many gardens. The daphne bears small rose-purple blossoms in
clusters along its branches in early spring before the leaves develop.
During the summer, several bright red berries appear, each with a
single seed. Some horticultural varieties produce white to yellow
flowers and yellow to orange berries.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The bark, (this
separates easily from the stems) leaves, and berries are poisonous.
Children are especially attracted to the berries and fatalities among
some who have eaten them have been reported.</p>

<p>Poisoning is characterized by a burning sensation in the mouth and
irritation of the stomach and intestines which causes severe cramps.
Toxic principles include a bitter glycoside, <b>daphnin</b>, and an
acid resinous mixture. If not removed reasonably soon, these can
produce kidney inflammation since these principles can be absorbed.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor.
Have patient vomit. Physicians perform gastric lavage and treat for
a probable irritation of the gastro-intestinal tract if parts of the
plant have been in the stomach for more than an hour.</p>

                <i>Digitalis purpurea—SCROPHULARIACEAE</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> The foxglove is
found wild in woodlands, along shady roadsides, and often is cultivated
in gardens. During its first year of growth it forms clusters of leaves
in a rosette pattern, but no flowers. The flowers develop on long erect
stems early in summer during the second year. They are numerous showy
white-lavender, or purple bell-shaped flowers which bloom for several
weeks. The fruits are dry capsules with many tiny seeds.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The leaves
and seeds. These contain the digitalis glycosides, chiefly
<b>digitoxin</b>, which is a powerful heart stimulant. Poisoning is
characterized by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness and can be experienced
several hours after ingesting the plant parts. The plant is severely
poisonous and can cause heart failure because of its powerful action on
the heart muscles.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidotes</b>:</span> Call your doctor.
Have patient vomit. Physicians perform gastric lavage and treat for
<b>digitoxin</b> and digitalis glycoside poisoning.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> This hellebore is
found in swampy places, moist meadows, or along the edges of streams.
It develops in early spring quite like the skunk cabbage, but then
grows during summer on a stout stalk up to 6 to 8 feet in height. Its
clasping broad leaves with parallel vein markings are conspicuous. Many
small greenish-white flowers form on a branching top.</p>

<p>The size of the plant attracts people, and children find the broad
leaves and green tops a curiosity. Powdered roots and a mixture of the
alkaloids are found among the contents of some insecticides.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> Poisonous
principles are alkaloids which are in largest amounts in the roots.
Leaves and seeds contain smaller quantities and can be harmful.
Poisoning is characterized by salivation, abdominal pain, and attempts
to vomit. Large quantities produce a cold and clammy skin and depressed
circulation due to effects of <b>veratrum</b> alkaloids on the heart
muscles and on respiration. Death may result.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor.
Have patient vomit if the victim has not become unconscious and
appears calm. If shock has developed, use standard first aid measures.
Physicians treat for <b>veratrum</b> alkaloid poisoning.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> This tall annual
weed is usually eradicated by local authorities as soon as it is found
because of its narcotic properties. Occasionally, however, it turns up
on dumps, along railroad tracks, or other places. Fruits or “seeds” of
the <i>Cannabis</i> for commercial purposes, have been pre-treated to
render them non-viable and of use in bird seed mixtures. At times, some
are not rendered sufficiently sterile and these, in the home refuse,
get to dump areas where they germinate. Plants can reach more than 6
feet in height.</p>

<p>Leaves are slender and divided into five to seven long, narrow,
pointed leaflets each with a saw-tooth margin. They are rough to the
touch, giving one the feeling of sand paper. Smaller flower bracts are
quite resinous and sticky. Flowers and fruits are rather inconspicuous
and scattered along upper portions of the stem. Male and female flowers
are borne on separate plants.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The leaves,
flowering parts, and resinous secretions contain the <i>Cannabis</i>
(<b>cannabinol</b>) narcotic principles. Publicity over the illegal
use of marihuana in its various forms, i.e., cigarettes, extracts,
pills, etc., make it a curiosity among some people. It causes cerebral
stimulation and excessive amounts produce hallucinations, delirium,
and eventually mental depression. It is a plant which can cause drug
addiction.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor. Have
patient vomit. Physicians treat for cerebral depression and other

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> There are numerous
garden varieties of the monkshood and it is widely cultivated. It is a
perennial herb reaching a height of about 3 to 4 feet with many divided
leaves (like a crow’s foot). Several violet-blue flowers form on a
flowering stalk somewhat like the delphinium or <a href="#Page_13">larkspur</a>,

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> Roots and seeds
are most poisonous although the leaves may be harmful if eaten. The
plant contains several poisonous alkaloids, chiefly <b>aconitine</b>,
which affects the vital vagus nerve from the brain causing a slowing

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> A biennial weed with
leaves resembling those of parsley, dark green, finely divided, with
shiny under surfaces. The plant is found in gardens, fields, and along
roadsides, and reaches up to 5 feet, or more, in height. Roots resemble
those of the parsnip. When crushed, both fresh leaves and roots yield
a juice with a characteristic odor of the parsnip. Occasional purplish
spots are found on the hollow stems.</p>

<p>The very small white flowers and grayish-green fruits are borne
on umbrella-like stalks. The tiny fruits upon close examination have
flattened inner surfaces. They also look somewhat like fruits of the
anise, <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> The leaves and
fruits during flowering contain an intensely poisonous principle,
<b>coniine</b>, and other related alkaloids. Older roots are also
poisonous. Hemlock poisoning first causes a burning sensation in the
mouth and throat followed by muscular weakness, stupor, and paralysis
of the arms and chest. Poisonous principles act on the spinal cord and
brain causing respiratory failure and death.</p>

<p>The poisonous hemlock juice was employed by ancient Greeks as a
means of capital punishment. Socrates and other celebrities are said
to have met death by this means. Accidental poisoning has occurred in
modern time by mistaking the conium for parsley, parsnip, or anise plants.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Description</b>:</span> Probably no other
plant has caused as much suffering and distress as has the poison-ivy.
Poison-ivy, with its characteristic three-leaf appearance and prominent
veins is a woody vine, climbing by aerial rootlets, or taking a
tree-like appearance. Poison-oak is more of a low, branching shrub.
Each leaflet is shaped somewhat like an oak leaf. Both are found
abundantly in woodlands, along fences, walks, and roadsides. During
the fall their showy red and yellow leaves are frequently mistaken for
those of the harmless trees of the woods.</p>

<p>The flowers are yellowish green to white in color and formed in
clusters attached to the stems, or in the stem forks. Fruits are
smooth globular structures, sometimes remaining on the branches until
spring.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> All parts of
the plant are poisonous, even the tiny plant hairs and the smoke from
burning the leaves in the fall. This plant produces a severe dermatitis
upon contact causing inflammation, blistering, and vesicles. As the
skin breaks, a liquid exudes and scabs or crusts form.</p>

<p>The poisonous principle is a reddish-brown, oil-resin containing
<b>urushiol</b>. This can produce irritant effects within 24 hours upon
contact with the skin.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidotes</b>:</span> Numerous remedies are
available in pharmacies for poison-ivy. After contact, or suspected
contact, hands, face, and affected parts should be first washed
freely with soapy water using laundry soap of the alkali kind; lather
abundantly. Soaps containing oil or greasy components should not be
used. The poison is soluble in them and will spread over the skin. In
severe or persistent cases of dermatitis, consult your physician.</p>

<p>Physicians treat itching, severe inflammation, and pain when
dermatitis becomes evident.</p>

growing up to about 4 feet, with a large fleshy root system. Stems are
rather thick and leaves have a light green appearance with prominent
ribs (veins) and somewhat curled edges.</p>

<p>Flowers are greenish-white and borne on a spike in the upper part
of the plant. As the many berries form in clusters in late summer and
early autumn, they are at first green then reddish-purple, later purple
to black, and contain a red juice which has also given the plant the
name red-ink plant. Birds frequently feed on them. The plant is found
in many areas.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> All parts are
poisonous, particularly roots, shoots, and unripe berries. As the
berries ripen, their poisonous properties lessen but, nevertheless,
if many are eaten, they too can be harmful. Toxic materials include a
resinous material and a water-soluble <b>saponin</b>. No alkaloid has
as yet been found in pokeweed.</p>

<p>Poisoning generally is slow (1 to 2 hours) after ingesting the plant
but then becomes violent for a long time. Following a period of nausea
and vomiting, drowsiness and impaired vision results. Large amounts can
cause purgation and narcosis followed by coma and death.</p>

poisonous.</p>

<p>As in the Conium hemlock, the roots of <i>Circuta</i> resemble
those of the parsnip but in addition, frequently possess many tuberous
rootlets which resemble small sweet potatoes. When cut open, these
yield a yellowish aromatic oil. Stems are shiny, hollow, and often
have purple spots. Leaf bases clasp around the stem and the leaves are
coarsely divided into smaller leaflets.</p>

<p>Flowers are white and the small fruits are formed on umbrella-like
stalks. Each fruit possesses several prominent corky ribs.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Poisonous Parts</b>:</span> Mostly the
roots. However, above ground parts are also very poisonous and should
be avoided. The similarity of roots to parsnip and sweet potato has led
to accidental poisoning in children and adults. The poison principle is
a resin-like substance called <b>cicutoxin</b> and a small quantity of
this can cause death.</p>

<p>Poisoning is characterized by severe stomach pain, great mental
excitation and frenzy, vomiting, and frothing at the mouth. The
frothing can be at times bloody. Breathing becomes irregular followed
by convulsions and death in a short time.</p>

<p><span class="fs_120"><b>Antidote</b>:</span> Call your doctor. Have
patient vomit. Physicians perform stomach lavage before the contents
